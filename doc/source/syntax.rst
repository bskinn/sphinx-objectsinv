Sphinx Objects.inv Syntax
=========================

*Not especially well documented.*

*Parsing is rather ad hoc.*

*Set header; virtually everything will be version two.*

*Project name and version must be included in the right format.*

*The fourth line has to contain 'zlib'*

*Everything else is in a particular syntax.*

*[All of this can be linked to the sphinx/intersphinx source on GitHub.*
