Sphinx Objects.inv Encoder/Decoder
==================================

*What? (convert v2 (since sphinx v1.0; sphinx-built docs from before ~July 2010 probably aren't encoded) .inv to human readable)*

*Why? (1. inspect contents for making intersphinx references. 2. Enable compilation
of objects.inv files for intersphinx interop with other documentation not built
with Sphinx.)*

Sphinx Objects.inv Encoder/Decoder is available on PyPI under the package name
``sphobjinv``::

    pip install sphobjinv

The project source repository is on GitHub: `bskinn/sphobjinv
